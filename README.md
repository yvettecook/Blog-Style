2. Unzip the files and rename the folder to `Detox`
4. Copy the folder into your Ghost theme directory `ghost/content/themes`
5. Restart ghost and log in to your dashboard

## Setting up comments

Detox comes with Moot comments installed, but YOU'LL NEED TO SET UP MOOT FOR YOUR OWN BLOG.

To set up Moot comments, do the following:

1. Go to: https://moot.it/ and create a new forum (near the bottom) and username for yourself.
2. Inside your new forum, create a discussion section that you'll use for comments (most people just name it "Posts").
3. Use a text editor to open the post.hbs file in this theme.
4. Find this code in that file:
	```
    <section id="comments">
        <a class="moot"
            title="{{title}}"
            href="https://moot.it/i/detox/posts:{{title}}">
            Comments for this blog entry
        </a>
    </section>
    ```
5. Replace "detox" with the name of the forum you created and "posts" with the name of the discussion section you created, like this:
	```
    href="https://moot.it/i/your-forumname/your-discusionsection:{{title}}"
    ```
Then you should be good to go!
